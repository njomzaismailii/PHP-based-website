            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Standing at the entrance to the restaurant you are immediately inundated by the aroma of escargots, filet mignons,<br>
               and roasted ducklings being served. These delicious smells are enough to make your mouth water and your stomach begin to growl.<br>
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
                Located at 201 West Orange Street in downtown Lancaster, The Loft is renowned for its unique atmosphere and even more so,<br>
               for its outstanding cuisine. The building in which The Loft is located, has been a dining establishment since the late 1800's.<br> 
               The eatery preceding The Loft was called Buckius Caf√©. The original restaurant owner gave the name, The Loft, to the establishment<br>
                in October of 1973.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Why the restaurant is called The Loft is obvious when you enter the second of two dining rooms. Looking upwards you will<br>
                see a rustic, open beam design that is adorned with potted plants and various antiques. Lining the walls are various knick-knacks<br> 
                and framed paintings from all over the world.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1987, European Master Chef, Gunter Backhaus bought the restaurant. At the time Backhaus was quoted as saying that it was his<br>
                goal to make The Loft one of the finest restaurants in Lancaster. According to patrons that have been eating at the restaurant for<br>
                years, he has accomplished this goal.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Although owning his own restaurant was a new experience for Backhaus, cooking was not. Backhaus began his culinary career as an <br>
                apprentice in Dusseldorf, Germany. Gaining the culinary skills he needed, Backhaus left his native Germany at the age of 18 to<br>
                 pursue bigger and better culinary opportunities. He traveled the world, working in hotels and restaurants in places such as Mexico,<br>
                 Bermuda, France, the Bahamas, Spain and England. The next stop on Backhaus' journey was the United States.</p>
